# Housing-Price-Regression-Analysis
This notebook uses the kaggle housing price analysis dataset. 
My focus in the notebook was building an scikit learn pipeline that can clean data then perform a basic grid search on some regression models. 

I entered this as my first Kaggle competition. Its not perfect but it was a great expereince to learn how to effectively build modeling pipelines, and work with a very large number of varaibles
